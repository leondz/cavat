A tool that performs Corpus Analysis and Validation for TimeML; a checking tool for statistical analysis of information specific to temporally-annotated natural language corpora in any language.

CAVaT enables you to validate and then extract information about any set of TimeML documents, reporting in a variety of formats (including CSV and LaTeX). It also includes a range of abstract checking modules that can check document and corpus integrity in a more thorough way than is possible with XML DTDs.

This Python tool is split into two parts - reporting over a corpus, which allows complex queries to be entered and processed; and also checking, which performs high-level validation of TimeML documents.

You can obtain CAVaT via direct download (see the panel on the left of the page) or via anonymous checkout (see the "source" tab for that). Help is included in the program via the "help" command, as well as a README. The paper concerning CAVaT can be found at: http://derczynski.com/sheffield/papers/cavat.pdf .

CAVaT has a monitored mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/cavat . It is tested and supported under Linux, though bug reports from other platforms are welcomed.
